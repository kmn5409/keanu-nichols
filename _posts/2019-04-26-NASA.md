So it's been awhile since I've actually written on my blog but I like to think my excuse was that I was working on a lot of things. Hence for example this is one of the big ones, so I've been accepted to the NASA-NIHERST International Internship to take place in Mountain View California for the summer. Is this a big thing, well to me it feels like an absolutely amazing opportunity!

## Tips for Applying:
# Partake in a number of different opportunites:
I believe it's important to take part in a number of different activities, in my case coming from a Computer Science background, I took part in a number of different competitions. For example I took part in the Teleios Code Jam, and a number of different coding competitions on things like HackerRank. I think moved more toward things like Data Science and looked at Kaggle. This exposed me to a number of different area in Computer Science and I had a better idea of what I was interested in.
