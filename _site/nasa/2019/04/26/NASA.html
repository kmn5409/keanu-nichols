So it’s been awhile since I’ve actually written on my blog but I like to think my excuse was that I was working on a lot of things. Hence for example this is one of the big ones, so I’ve been accepted to the NASA-NIHERST International Internship to take place in Mountain View California for the summer. Is this a big thing, well to me it feels like an absolutely amazing opportunity!</p>

<h2 id="tips-for-applying">Tips for Applying:</h2>
<h1 id="partake-in-a-number-of-different-opportunites">Partake in a number of different opportunites:</h1>
<p>I believe it’s important to take part in a number of different activities, in my case coming from a Computer Science background, I took part in a number of different competitions. For example I took part in the Teleios Code Jam, and a number of different coding competitions on things like HackerRank. I think moved more toward things like Data Science and looked at Kaggle. This exposed me to a number of different area in Computer Science and I had a better idea of what I was interested in.</p>

<p><br />
For a look at what I’m doing to prepare for the internship
you can check out this <a href="https://github.com/kmn5409/NASA_Preparation/tree/master/TensorFlow">repository</a> right now I’m working on 
some tensorflow stuff</p>

<p>So I actually will be taking part in an Interview and well these are the links for anyone who is interested in seeing them:
